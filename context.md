# Hello,
Delivering reliable, scalable financial and enterprise systems for the next generation of African innovation.

I am **Abdel Lita**,  
**Software Engineer – Fullstack & Backend**, specialized in **Enterprise Systems**, **Banking Software**, **Payments**, and **Process Automation**.

I build production-grade solutions that power real institutions — from HR platforms to Core Banking components, payment workflows, and enterprise middleware.

## About Me
I’m a bilingual (EN/FR) engineer with hands-on experience building systems that keep organisations running:
- **Core Banking (CBS)** modules

- **Enterprise Human Resource (E-HR)** systems  
- **Middleware** for integrating internal and external services  
- **Workflow automation** with Camunda BPMN  
- **APIs & microservice architectures** in Java Spring Boot and Node.js  

I work on complex, high-impact systems used daily by staff, accountants, HR teams, and financial departments.  
My strength is understanding both **business logic** and **technical architecture**, allowing me to deliver solutions that are both functional and robust.
